## Overview üìñ

Hash (HSH), is a Cryptographic Hash Algorithms Library for secure
password management. Utilizing the cutting-edge [Blake3][11] algorithm,
this library generates and verifies hashed passwords with ease.

The library features a struct for storing and verifying hashed
passwords, as well as a series of methods for calculating entropy,
generating hashes, accessing password and hash values, and more.

`HSH` also implements the Default and Display traits for flexible use
and easy readability.

## Features ‚ú®

The `Hash` struct is designed to store and verify password hashes using
the `BLAKE3` cryptographic hash function. The struct has several fields,
including the password and its hash, both represented as strings.

- The `Hash` struct also provides several methods to interact with the
password and its hash.
- The `entropy` method calculates the entropy of the hash in bits based
on the Shannon entropy formula.
- The `generate_hash` method hashes the password and returns the hash
as a string.
- The `hash` and `hash_length` methods provide access to the stored hash
and its length, respectively.
- The `new` method creates a new instance of the Hash struct with
default values for the password and hash.
- The `password` and `password_length` methods provide access to the
stored password and its length, respectively.
- The `set_hash` and `set_password` methods allow you to update the
stored hash and password, respectively.
- Finally, the `verify` method verifies the password against the stored
hash and returns a Boolean indicating whether they match.

The Hash struct implements the `std::fmt::Display trait`, which allows
it to be formatted as a string for printing. The struct also implements
the `Default` trait, which allows it to be initialized with default
values.

## Installation üì¶

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `hsh`.

### Requirements

`hsh` requires Rust **1.67.0** or later.

### Documentation

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info:** Please check out our [website][0] for more information
and find our documentation on [docs.rs][9], [lib.rs][10] and
[crates.io][8].

## Usage üìñ

To use `hsh` in your project, add the following to your
`Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
hsh = "0.0.1"
```

Add the following to your `main.rs` file:

```rust
extern crate hsh;
use hsh::*;
```

then you can use the functions in your application code.

### Examples

`HRC` comes with a set of examples that you can use to get started. The
examples are located in the `examples` directory of the project. To run
the examples, clone the repository and run the following command in your
terminal from the project root directory.

```shell
cargo run --example hsh
```
