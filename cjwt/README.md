## Overview üìñ

The Core JWT (CJWT) is a struct with a JWT token and claims. It has
functions for working with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and JSON Web
Signatures (JWSs). JWTs have three parts: a header, a payload, and a
signature. The header and payload are JSON objects. They're serialized
to UTF-8 bytes and encoded with base64url encoding.

## Features ‚ú®

- [x] JWT token generation
- [x] JWT token validation
- [x] JWT token signing

## Installation üì¶

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `cjwt`.

### Requirements

`cjwt` requires Rust **1.67.0** or later.

### Documentation

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info:** Please check out our [website][0] for more information
