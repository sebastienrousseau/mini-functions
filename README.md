## Overview üìñ

`Mini Functions` is a highly performant utility and wrapper functions library for Rust that has been carefully designed with optimization and efficiency in mind. By providing convenient wrapper functions, our library aims to provide a high-level interface for common tasks while still leveraging the performance benefits of Rust under the hood. These utility functions serve as an essential toolkit for any Rust developer, and the library's design abstractions allow for easy integration into a variety of projects and applications.

## Functionality üìö

`Mini Functions` is a library of functions for Rust that provides a collection of tools for working with various aspects of a Rust application. The `mini-functions` library consists of the following `non-exhaustive` functions:

| Functions | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Claims ‚ßâ][12] | The **Claim functions** are used to retrieve and manipulate information about claims. These functions are used to create and manage claims in JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and JSON Web Signatures (JWS). |
| [Common ‚ßâ][13] | The **Common functions** are used to retrieve and manipulate information about common data types. |
| [Date ‚ßâ][14] | The **Date and time functions** are used to retrieve and manipulate information about dates and times. |
| [Errors ‚ßâ][15] | The **Error functions** are used to retrieve and manipulate information about errors. |
| [Hash ‚ßâ][16] | The **Hash functions** are used to retrieve and manipulate information about hashes. |
| [Logs ‚ßâ][17] | The **Log functions** are used to retrieve and manipulate information about logs. |
| [JWT ‚ßâ][18] | The **Jot functions** are used to retrieve and manipulate information about JSON Object Tokens (JOT). |
| [MD5 ‚ßâ][19] | The **MD5 functions** are used to retrieve and manipulate information about MD5. |
| [QR ‚ßâ][20] | The **QR functions** are used to retrieve and manipulate information about QR codes. |
| [Random ‚ßâ][21] | The **Random functions** are used to retrieve and manipulate information about random data. |

See [Documentation][08] for full API details.

## Getting Started üöÄ

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `mini-functions`.

### Requirements

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently Rust
**1.56.0** or later (stable).

### Installation

To install `mini-functions`, you need to have the Rust toolchain installed on your machine. You can install the Rust toolchain by following the instructions on the [Rust website ‚ßâ][10].

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install `mini-functions` using the following command:

```shell
cargo install mini-functions
```

## Usage üìñ

To use the `mini-functions` library in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
mini-functions = "0.0.8"
```

Add the following to your `main.rs` file:

```rust
extern crate mini_functions;
use mini_functions::*;
```

then you can use the functions in your application code.

### Platform support

`mini-functions` is supported and tested on the following platforms:
