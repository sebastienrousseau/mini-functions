Mini Functions is a highly performant utility and wrapper functions
library for Rust that has been carefully designed with optimization and
efficiency in mind. By providing convenient wrapper functions, our
library aims to provide a high-level interface for common tasks while
still leveraging the performance benefits of Rust under the hood. These
utility functions serve as an essential toolkit for any Rust developer,
and the library's design abstractions allow for easy integration into a
variety of projects and applications.
