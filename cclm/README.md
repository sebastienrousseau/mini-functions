## Overview üìñ

The Claims library holds JSON Web Token (JWT) claims. It provides an
RFC7519 compliant implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and JSON
Web Signature (JWS) for Rust.

The [**`Claims`**](./struct.Claims.html) type is provided to hold
the claims of a JWT. The claims are stored in a `HashMap` and can be
accessed using the `get_claim`, `set_claim`, `remove_claim`, and
`has_claim` methods.

## Features ‚ú®

The following table lists the optional reserved claims that are
supported:

| Claim | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `aud` (Audience) | Identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. |
| `custom` (Custom) | Custom claims are used to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims. |
| `did` (Decentralized Identifier) | A string value that uniquely identifies a subject. |
| `exp` (Expiration Time) | Identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing. |
| `iat` (Issued At) | Identifies the time at which the JWT was issued. |
| `iss` (Issuer) | Identifies the principal that issued the JWT. |
| `jti` (JWT ID) | Provides a unique identifier for the JWT. |
| `nbf` (Not Before) | Identifies the time before which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing. |
| `sub` (Subject) | Identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT. |
| `vc` (Verifiable Credential) | A Credential that is tamper-evident and has authorship that can be cryptographically verified. |
| `vp` (Verifiable Presentation) | A Presentation that is tamper-evident and has authorship that can be cryptographically verified. |

## Installation üì¶

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `cclm`.

### Requirements

`cclm` requires Rust **1.67.0** or later.

### Documentation

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info:** Please check out our [website][0] for more information
and find our documentation on [docs.rs][9], [lib.rs][10] and
[crates.io][8].

## Usage üìñ

To use `cclm` in your project, add the following to your
`Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
cclm = "0.0.1"
```

Add the following to your `main.rs` file:

```rust
extern crate cclm;
use cclm::*;
```

then you can use the functions in your application code.

### Examples

`CCLM` comes with a set of examples that you can use to get started. The
examples are located in the `examples` directory of the project. To run
the examples, clone the repository and run the following command in your
terminal from the project root directory.

```shell
cargo run --example cclm
```
