## Overview üìñ

The Varied (VRD) library is an implementation of a pseudorandom number
generator using the Mersenne Twister algorithm.

The library generates random integers uniformly distributed in the range
of 0 to (2^32 - 1) and supports generating random booleans, characters,
floats, integers, and vectors of random bytes.

- `vrd` provides functions to return random values with a specific
probability, choose a random element from a slice of values, and
generate random values within a given range.
- The library also provides a struct named Random which contains an
array of unsigned 32-bit integers and an index used to generate random
numbers.
- The index is incremented after each random number is generated, and
the array is reinitialized when the index reaches 624.
- The library uses an extern crate 'rand' and uses its thread_rng
function to generate random numbers.

## Features ‚ú®

- Pseudorandom number generation: The library uses the Mersenne Twister
  algorithm to generate pseudorandom integers uniformly distributed in 0
  to (2^32 - 1) using an array of unsigned 32-bit integers and an index.
- Random number types: The library provides several methods to generate
  different types of random numbers including bool, bytes, char, float,
  and int.
- Range of values: The methods for generating random numbers allow the
  user to specify the range of values for the output.
- Random element selection: The library provides a method to choose a
  random element from a given slice of values.
- Initialization: The library provides a new() method to create a new
  instance of the random number generator.
- Optimization: The library is optimized for performance with the number
  of elements in the array set to 624 and the number of elements to skip
  set to 397.
- Constant values: The library uses several constant values in the
  Mersenne Twister algorithm including MATRIX_A, UPPER_MASK, LOWER_MASK,
  TEMPERING_MASK_B, and TEMPERING_MASK_C.

## Installation üì¶

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `vrd`.

### Requirements

`vrd` requires Rust **1.67.0** or later.

### Documentation

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info:** Please check out our [website][0] for more information
and find our documentation on [docs.rs][9], [lib.rs][10] and
[crates.io][8].

## Usage üìñ

To use `vrd` in your project, add the following to your
`Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
vrd = "0.0.1"
```

Add the following to your `main.rs` file:

```rust
extern crate vrd;
use vrd::*;
```

then you can use the functions in your application code.

### Examples

`VRD` comes with a set of examples that you can use to get started. The
examples are located in the `examples` directory of the project. To run
the examples, clone the repository and run the following command in your
terminal from the project root directory.

```shell
cargo run --example vrd
```

## Semantic Versioning Policy üö•
