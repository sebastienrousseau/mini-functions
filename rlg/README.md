## Overview üìñ

Rust Logs (RLG) is a library that implements application-level logging
in a simple, readable output format. The library provides logging APIs
and various helper macros that simplify many common logging tasks.

## Features ‚ú®

- Supports many log levels: `ALL`, `DEBUG`, `DISABLED`, `ERROR`,
  `FATAL`, `INFO`, `NONE`, `TRACE`, `VERBOSE` and `WARNING`,
- Provides structured log formats that are easy to parse and filter,
- Compatible with multiple output formats including:
  - Common Event Format (CEF),
  - Extended Log Format (ELF),
  - Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF),
  - JavaScript Object Notation (JSON),
  - NCSA Common Log Format (CLF),
  - W3C Extended Log File Format (W3C),
  - and many more

## Installation üì¶

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `rlg`.
