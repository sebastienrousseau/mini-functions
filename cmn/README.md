## Overview üìñ

Common (CMN), a Rust library designed for developers who are looking for
a comprehensive collection of mathematical and cryptographic constants.

`CMN` is a modern, fast, and user-friendly library that makes it easy to
access a wide range of mathematical and cryptographic constants,
including the mathematical constant `Euler`, the `hash` algorithm used,
the `cost` of the hash algorithm, the `length` of the hash, the
mathematical constant `Phi`, the mathematical constant `Pi`, the
`Planck` constant, a set of `special` characters, and much more.

## Features ‚ú®

The library includes two main structures: `Constant` and `Constants`.

- The `Constant` structure holds the name and value of each constant as
a `&'static str` and a `String`, respectively.
- The Constants structure implements a method constants that returns a
`Vec<Constant>` containing all the available constants.
- The available constants include the mathematical constants `EULER`,
`PHI`, `PI`, `PLANCK`, and `SQRT5`, and the cryptographic constants
`HASH_ALGORITHM`, `HASH_COST`, `HASH_LENGTH`, and `SPECIAL_CHARS`.
- The library also includes an enumeration `ConstantValue` that
represents the different constant values. The values can be an
`f64 float`, a `String`, a `u32`, a `usize`, or a `&'static [char]`
array of characters.

## Installation üì¶

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `cmn`.

### Requirements

`cmn` requires Rust **1.67.0** or later.

### Documentation

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info:** Please check out our [website][0] for more information
and find our documentation on [docs.rs][9], [lib.rs][10] and
[crates.io][8].

## Usage üìñ

To use `cmn` in your project, add the following to your
`Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
cmn = "0.0.1"
```

Add the following to your `main.rs` file:

```rust
extern crate cmn;
use cmn::*;
```

then you can use the functions in your application code.

### Examples

`CMN` comes with a set of examples that you can use to get started. The
examples are located in the `examples` directory of the project. To run
the examples, clone the repository and run the following command in your
terminal from the project root directory.

```shell
cargo run --example cmn
```

## Semantic Versioning Policy üö•

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain
backward compatibility, `CMN` follows [semantic versioning][7].
