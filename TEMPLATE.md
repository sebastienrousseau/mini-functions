## Overview ðŸ“–

`Mini Functions` is a highly performant utility and wrapper functions library for Rust that has been carefully designed with optimization and efficiency in mind. By providing convenient wrapper functions, our library aims to provide a high-level interface for common tasks while still leveraging the performance benefits of Rust under the hood. These utility functions serve as an essential toolkit for any Rust developer, and the library's design abstractions allow for easy integration into a variety of projects and applications.
