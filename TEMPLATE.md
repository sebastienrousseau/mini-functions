## Welcome to Mini Functions 👋

`Mini Functions` is a highly performant utility and wrapper functions library for Rust that has been carefully designed with optimization and efficiency in mind.

By providing convenient wrapper functions, our library aims to provide a high-level interface for common tasks while still leveraging the performance benefits of Rust under the hood.

These utility functions serve as an essential toolkit for any Rust developer, and the library's design abstractions allow for easy integration into a variety of projects and applications.

## Key Features 🎯

- **Built with Rust** — A modern programming language that is well-suited for building high-performance, reliable, and secure systems.
- **High-level Utility Functions** — A collection of high-level, abstracted functions for common tasks, such as string manipulation, file manipulation, and data parsing.
- **Wrapper Functions for Easy Access** — Wrapper functions that provide a more convenient interface for accessing and using underlying Rust libraries or APIs.
- **Optimization and Performance Tools** — Tools for optimizing and improving the performance of Rust code.
- **Multi-platform Support** — Support for a variety of platforms, including desktop, mobile, and web.
- **Comprehensive Documentation and Examples** — Documentation and examples to help developers understand and use the library effectively.
- **Regular Maintenance and Updates** — Regular updates and maintenance to ensure the library stays up-to-date and reliable.
