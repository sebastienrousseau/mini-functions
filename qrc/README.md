## Overview üìñ

The QR Code Library (QRC) is a versatile tool for generating and
manipulating QR code images in various formats.

With this library, you can easily convert your data into a QR code,
whether it be in the form of a string or a vector of bytes.

Choose from popular image formats like PNG, JPG, GIF and SVG, and even
customize the size and color of your QR code.

## Features ‚ú®

`QRC` features a `QRCode` struct that can be constructed with a
`Vec<u8>` of data or a `String` of data that will be converted to
a `Vec<u8>`.

The QR code can be generated using the `to_qrcode`method, and specific
image formats can be generated using the`to_png`,`to_jpg`, and`to_gif`
methods.

Each of these methods takes a `width` parameter and returns an
`ImageBuffer` containing the QR code image.

The library uses the qrcode and image crates to generate the QR code
images.

## Installation üì¶

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `qrc`.
